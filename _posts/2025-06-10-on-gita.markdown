Through the Khyber came the Aryans,
on horsebacks, into forested lands—
green now, once dust and silence.

They lit fires in the woods they cleared,
and with flame came worship.
Old people turned inward,
toward stillness, toward silence.

Wars broke. Races mingled.
Gods were shared in smoky air.
Aryans brought rituals,
others brought the soul of the idea.
And a ladder was built—
those closest to fire rose,
those mixed with earth sowed.

Rituals deepened thought,
but work did not stop.
After each fire, they asked:
“What is the point of it all?”
These questions became the Upanishads—
echoes in quiet minds.

Knowledge passed,
but only to some.
The rest were needed,
to keep the wheels turning,
to keep the fire alive.

The ones atop became scribes—
they listened to bards,
wove myths into lines,
and slowly, a religion grew.

Centuries passed.
Ascetics multiplied—
top to bottom, silence spread.

Then came Shankara,
fire in mind,
not bound to rite nor retreat.
He debated all,
rose swift,
found the land’s greatest tale:
the Mahabharata.

In its heart, a warrior—
the Vrishni hero,
in trance,
speaking of inaction,
yet exalting action.
One mind in all forms,
he said.
Use them fully—
there is no better thing.

Shankara was moved.
He wrote as none before.
“This is the truth,” he said—
“All is one,
but action must go on.”

And that is what the Gita is.
