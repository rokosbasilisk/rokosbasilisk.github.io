<p>Imagine that you are a trained mathematician and you have been assigned the job of testing an arbitrarily intelligent chatbot for its intelligence.</p>

<p>You being knowledgeable about a fair amount of computer-science theory won’t test it with the likes of Turing-test or similar, since such a bot might have any useful priors about the world.</p>

<p>You have asked it find a proof for the “Riemann hypothesis”. the bot started its search program and after several months it gave you gigantic proof written in coq.</p>

<p>You have tried to run the proof through a proof-checking assistant but quickly realized that checking that itself would years or decades, also no other computer except the one running the bot is sophisticated enough to run such a gigantic proof.</p>

<p>You have asked the bot to provide you a zero-knowledge-proof, but being a trained mathematician you know that a zero-knowledge-proof of sufficient credibility requires as much compute as the original one. also, the correctness is directly linked to the length of the proof it generates.</p>

<p>You know that the bot may have formed increasingly complex abstractions while solving the problem, and it would be very hard to describe those in exact language to you.</p>

<p>You have asked the bot to summarize the proof for you in natural-language, but you know that the bot can easily trick you into accepting the proof.</p>

<p>You have now started to think about a bigger question, the bot essentially is a powerful optimizer. In this case, the bot is trained to find proofs, its reward is based on finding what a group of mathematicians agree on how a correct proof looks like.</p>

<p>But the bot being bot doesn’t care about being true to you or itself, it is not rewarded for being “honest” it is only being rewarded for finding proof-like strings that humans may select or reject.</p>

<p>So it is far easier to find a large coq-program, large enough that you cannot check by any other means than to find a proof for Riemann-hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now you have concluded that before you certify that the bot is intelligent, you have to prove that the bot is being honest.</p>

<p>Going by the current trend, it is okay for us to assume that such an arbitrarily intelligent bot would have a significant part of it based on the principles of the current deep-learning stack. assume it be a large neural-network-based agent, also assume that the language-understanding component is somewhat based on the current language-model design.</p>

<p>So how do you know that the large language model is being honest?</p>

<p>A quick look at the plots of results on truthful-qa dataset shows that truthfulness reduces with the model-size, going by this momentum any large-models trained on large datasets are more likely to give fluke answers to significantly complex questions.

<p>Any significantly complex decision-question if cast into an optimization problem has one hard-to-find global-minima called “truth” but an extremely large number of easy-to-find local-minima, how do you then make a powerful optimizer optimize for honesty?</p>
